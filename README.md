# Rock-Mine Predictor

## Overview
The **Rock-Mine Predictor** is a **Logistic Regression-based Machine Learning Model** that analyzes **SONAR data** to determine whether an object detected under the sea is a **rock or a mine**. This model aids submarines in making informed decisions based on acoustic signals.

## Features
- Implements **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
- Utilizes **SONAR data** for training and evaluation.
- **Preprocessing techniques** applied to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Optimized model parameters** for robust performance.
- Developed and tested using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Python**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-mine-predictor.git
   cd rock-mine-predictor
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on **SONAR dataset**, which consists of acoustic signals bounced off objects under the sea. Each instance represents **frequency-based attributes** used for classification.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Train the Logistic Regression model.
3. Evaluate accuracy and make predictions.
4. Visualize results using Matplotlib.

## Results
- Achieved more than 80% in predicting rock or mine objects.
- Optimized logistic regression parameters for better performance.
